# morse-code

We are to create a number of functions that take an input and output the English in Morse Code. 
I have used If Else statements to move through the Array and work out whether or not the letter used is needed. 

We are to test all of the functions that we use, with the final product being tested as a whole.

After creating a translator that translates on blue, my next aim will be to add a button that translates, plus the ability to translate in reverse, which should be simple enough.
